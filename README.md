 .

# Abstract
The goal of this project is to do basic EDA and visualization , to do Analyzing and Recommending Books ,  'prediction of book reviews' and use regression to predict that

# Design
This project is one of the T5 Data Science BootCamp requirements. based on the data from Goodreads-books  
I well answer to these questions 

- How many reviews on books ?
- Who is the most author that published books ?
- What is the most language written by ?
- What is the most rated books ?
-Who is the Highly rated author ? 

# Data
To achieve the goal of this study the dataset Goodreads-books will be used. This dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks 
 
the dataset contains information about books, it contains 11123 rows , 12 column (feature)
 Let's take a look :

- bookID - Contains the unique ID for each book/series
- title - contains the titles of the books
- authors 
- average_rating 
- ISBN -  the International Standard Book Number
- isbn13 - the International Standard Book Number
- language_code - Helps understand what is the primary language of the book
- Num_pages 
- Ratings_count - Total number of ratings the book received.
- text_reviews_count - Total number of written text reviews the book received

# Tools
- numpy & pandas for data manipulation (EDA)
- matplotlib & seaborn for plotting
- Scikit-learn for modeling 

# Algorithm
- sklearn :  Linear Regression & may be logistic Regression 
predictions :
- the performance of predicted train set is : 75%
- R^2 for train set : 75%
- Adjusted R-Squared for training set : 75%
